    C coders use a pointer to void to tell programmers that this pointer

    a function, variable, struct, etc. This allows for code *flexibility*.

    because we know what this pointer actually points to since udp_rx_args_t is 
    a type specific to udp_rx_thr.c/.h. That is, if you are calling 
    udp_rx_thr_init(), you have already read this file which tells shows you
    what will happen to the input argument `args`. */
