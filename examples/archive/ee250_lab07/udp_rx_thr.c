/**
 * TODO (Lab 08): implement this function for the RSS and PRR lab assignment
 *
 * For each packet you receive, you need to extract the Received Signal Strength
 * Indicator (RSSI) from the layer 2 header. There is a lot of confusion with 
 * RSSI and RSS (Received Signal Strength without the I). RSSI is supposed to be
 * a number that helps indicate the RSS, which is the actual received power in 
 * dBm. This function should ultimately extract the RSS (in dBm) which can be 
 * found in the L2 header of the the packet and print it out. 
 * 
 * When you find the gnrc_pktsnip_t of type GNRC_NETTYPE_NETIF, *data points to
 * the header contents which is standardized in the RIOT code to be in the 
 * format of the struct gnrc_netif_hdr_t. To read out that header, you need to 
 * cast the pointer to the type gnrc_netif_hdr_t. Then, you will be able to 
 * access the rssi field of the header. When you get the rssi field, you  MUST
 * subtract 73 from it to convert it to an actual dBm value as per CC2538's
 * user guide. Otherwise, you'll get numbers of 30 dBm or higher, which makes no
 * sense!
 * 
 * RIOT developers decided to create a field in the gnrc_netif_hdr_t struct 
 * named rssi even though the standard in the entire codebase is to actually 
 * have this field represent the RSS in dBm, not RSSI, which we believe to be 
 * incorrect. Nonetheless, this does not affect the final result we are looking
 * for. Even though it's named RSSI, treat it as the actual received power, RSS.
 *
 * If you need more examples, you can take a look at how _dump_snip() in 
 * gnrc_pktdump.c accesses the the L2 header data when you have a pointer to the
 * L2 packet snip. _dump_snip() will call gnrc_netif_hdr_print() (implemented in
 * gnrc_netif_hdr_print.c) which will then print out each piece of the L2 header.

      C coders use a pointer to void to tell programmers that this pointer

      a function, variable, struct, etc. This allows for code *flexibility*.
